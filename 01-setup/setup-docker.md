## 2. Start Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop must be running before any `docker` commands will work.

### How to start it
- macOS: Applications → Docker Desktop
- Windows: Start Menu → Docker Desktop

### How to confirm it is running
Look for the Docker icon:
- macOS: top menu bar
- Windows: system tray (bottom right)

Wait until Docker Desktop shows a ready status (for example “Docker Desktop is running”).
